        Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies
        during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends,
        Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the

          <p>
            The book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997
            by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following
            year by Scholastic Corporation under the title Harry Potter and the
            Sorcerer's Stone. It won most of the British book awards that were
            judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the
            top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August
            1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000.
            It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been
            made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of
            its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies,
            making it the third best-selling novel of all time.<br />Most
            reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination,
            humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although
            a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing
            has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite
            authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before
            the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller
            Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to
            Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it
            placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring
            contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming
            obstacles like bullies.<br />Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
            Stone, along with the rest of the Harry Potter series, has been
            attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries
            because of accusations that the novels promote witchcraft under the
            guise of a heroic, moral story. Other religious commentators have
            written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including
            the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions
            shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of
            object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and
            marketing.

            Harry Potter lives with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and
            Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry's eleventh
            birthday, a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid personally delivers an
            acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
            revealing that Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards.
            When Harry was one year old, an evil and powerful dark wizard, Lord
            Voldemort, murdered his parents. Harry survived Voldemort's killing
            curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving
            a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. Unknown to Harry,
            he is famous in the wizarding world.<br />Hagrid takes Harry to
            Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in
            London. Harry's parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringotts
            Wizarding Bank. Harry buys school supplies and a wand from
            Ollivander. The cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have
            feathers from the same phoenix bird, making them "brothers". Hagrid
            gives Harry an owl that he names Hedwig. A month later, Harry boards
            the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret
            Platform 9¬æ. On the journey to Hogwarts, Harry befriends fellow
            first-year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two boys
            initially dislike. Harry runs afoul of first-year student, Draco
            Malfoy.<br />At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the
            first-years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
            Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and
            talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for dark wizards, while Harry,
            Ron and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor.<br />Harry's broomstick
            flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as
            the Seeker. Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who
            favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry
            and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after
            curfew. Hermione, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising
            Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a
            gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry and Ron later
            save Hermione from a troll during the school's Halloween celebration
            and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg
            injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry, Ron and Hermione believe he
            is attempting to enter the trapdoor.<br />Hermione warns the boys
            against investigating further and instead directs Harry's attention
            to his first Quidditch match. His broomstick's attempts to buck him
            off and Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces
            Hermione he jinxed Harry's broom. Harry receives an anonymous
            Christmas gift ‚Äì his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to
            explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows
            what the viewer most desires. Harry sees his parents.<br />The trio
            read a newspaper report about an attempted robbery at Gringotts Bank
            and the same vault from which Hagrid retrieved an item for the
            school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. They suspect
            the object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which
            grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into
            pure gold. A forest centaur named Firenze warns Harry that Voldemort
            is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore
            is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and
            Ron fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.<br />A
            series of obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while
            Harry proceeds. Harry encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence
            Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals that he jinxed Harry's
            broom and let the troll into the school; Snape was protecting Harry.
            Voldemort, whose face is attached to the back of Quirrell's head, is
            using Quirrell to obtain the philosopher's stone. Harry is forced to
            stand before the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of
            greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell
            attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, but his flesh burns upon
            contact with him. Harry's scar begins hurting and he passes out.<br />Harry
            awakens in the school's infirmary. Dumbledore explains Harry
            survived Voldemort because his mother sacrificing her life for him
            left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused
            him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned him to die.
            Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the
            philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas
            Flamel alive, has been destroyed to prevent its being stolen. During
            the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup.
            Harry returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school
            year.

            <p>
              He is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a "scrawny, black-haired,
              green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard."
              She developed the series' story and characters to explain how
              Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from
              there. Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take
              place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh
              birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on
              Harry's forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort
              is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became
              the first person in a century to get on their team in their first
              year.

            <p>
              He is Harry's age and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best
              friend "always there when you need him." He is freckled,
              red-haired and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood
              family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is
              quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty
              and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital
              part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.

            <p>
              She is the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who
              has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of
              term. Rowling described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and
              good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of
              failure beneath her swottiness". Despite her nagging efforts to
              keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of
              the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and
              analytical skills play an important role in finding the
              Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large
              front teeth.

              He is a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black
              hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was
              snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again),
              however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's
              gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care
              and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most
              dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to
              Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and,
              later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.

              silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the
              headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard
              Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements
              in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own
              brilliance. Rowling described him as the "epitome of goodness".

            <p>She is a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun and teaches Transfiguration. She is Deputy Headmistress, and Head of Gryffindor House. McGonagall is considered to be a formidable witch who is skilled in many forms of magic, notably transfiguration and spell-casting. She is able to perform certain magic without casting spells or sometimes without the use of a wand. McGonagall is a registered Animagus and can transform herself into a tabby cat at will. McGonagall was always held in high respect by her peers and students at Hogwarts and commanded a position second only to Dumbledore.</p>

            <p>He has a hooked nose, sallow complexion and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.</p>

            <p>He is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard  and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.</p>

          <p><br>Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.<br>In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard" and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".<br>Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as "the epitome of goodness". His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.<br>The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate, and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:<br><i><b>The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry‚Äîhe tried to curse him. ... And‚Äîso‚Äîbut for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.</b></i></p>

          <p>
            Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, most prominently Peeves the poltergeist. Actor Rik Mayall was cast in the role, but his scenes were ultimately cut from the film and never released. The book's first chapter, told from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley, is absent from the film. Harry and Draco's first encounter in Madam Malkin's robe shop and the midnight duel are not in the film. In the film, the responsibility of taking Norbert away is given to Dumbledore, while in the book, Harry and Hermione have to bring him by hand to Charlie Weasley's friends. This necessitated a change in the detention plotline: in the book, Filch catches Harry and Hermione leaving the Astronomy Tower and puts them in detention with Neville and Malfoy, while in the film, all three protagonists receive detention after Malfoy finds them in Hagrid's hut after hours. According to Kloves, this was "the one part of the book that [Rowling] felt easily could be changed". The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers. The book's timeline is not enforced in the film. In the book, Harry's eleventh birthday is in 1991. On the film set for 4 Privet Drive, Dudley's certificates from primary school bear the year 2001.
