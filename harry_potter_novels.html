        Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British
        author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard,
        Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of
        whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The
        main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark
        wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing
        body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and
        Muggles (non-magical people).

            The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the
            United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All
            versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy. A
            series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age
            fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of
            mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of
            Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural
            meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is
            death.[3] Other major themes in the series include prejudice,
            corruption, and madness. <br />Since the release of the first novel,
            Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books
            have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial
            success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well
            as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern
            literature. As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500
            million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series
            in history, and have been translated into more than eighty
            languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the
            fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling
            roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million
            copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
            <br />The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part
            namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2016, the total
            value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,
            making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of
            all time. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a
            story co-written by Rowling. <br />The success of the books and
            films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous
            derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago
            in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital
            platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new
            information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films
            premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find
            Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions,
            collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been
            built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around
            the world.

            The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the
            first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry lives in
            a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt,
            uncle and cousin. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal,
            but at the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He
            meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that as a
            baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort.
            When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and
            Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.<br />Harry
            becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House.
            He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor
            wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or
            Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master,
            Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood
            Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with; and the Defence
            Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to
            be allied with Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry's
            confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body,
            yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance
            that bestows everlasting life.<br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of
            Secrets describes Harry's second year at Hogwarts. Students are
            attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle
            parentage are the primary targets. The attacks appear related to the
            Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school. Harry
            discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which
            he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione
            is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber's secrets and enter
            it. Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron's younger
            sister, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by an old diary in her
            belongings. The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger
            self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk, an
            ancient monster that kills those who make direct eye contact. Harry
            draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the
            basilisk and destroys the diary.<br />In the third novel, Harry
            Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted
            by Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his
            parents' murder. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the
            dementors – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he
            reaches out to Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the
            Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into
            the Shrieking Shack; Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed
            to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black
            was James Potter's best friend; he was framed by Peter Pettigrew,
            who hides as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin
            transforms into a werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after
            him but are surrounded by dementors. They are saved by a mysterious
            figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a
            future version of Harry, who traveled back in time with Hermione
            using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a
            Hippogriff.<br />In Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in Harry
            Potter and the Goblet of Fire), he is unwillingly entered in the
            Triwizard Tournament, a contest between schools of witchcraft and
            wizardry. Harry is Hogwarts' second participant after Cedric
            Diggory, an unusual occurrence that causes his friends to distance
            themselves from him. He competes against schools Beauxbatons and
            Durmstrang with the help of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts
            professor, Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody. Harry claims the Triwizard Cup
            with Cedric, but in doing so is teleported to a graveyard where
            Voldemort's supporters convene. Moody reveals himself be to Barty
            Crouch, Jr, a Death Eater. Harry manages to escape, but Cedric is
            killed and Voldemort is resurrected using Harry's blood.<br />In the
            fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry
            of Magic refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned. Dumbledore
            re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society to counter
            Voldemort; meanwhile, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the
            High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. Umbridge bans the Defense Against the
            Dark Arts; in response, Hermione and Ron form "Dumbledore's Army", a
            secret group where Harry teaches what Umbridge forbids. Harry is
            punished for disobeying Umbridge, and dreams of a dark corridor in
            the Ministry of Magic. Near the end of the book, Harry falsely
            dreams of Sirius being tortured; he races to the Ministry where he
            faces Death Eaters. The Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers'
            lives, but Sirius is killed. A prophecy concerning Harry and
            Voldemort is then revealed: one must die at the hands of the
            other.<br />In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
            Prince, Snape teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts while Horace
            Slughorn becomes the Potions master. Harry finds an old textbook
            with annotations by the Half-Blood Prince, due to which he achieves
            success in Potions class. Harry also takes lessons with Dumbledore,
            viewing memories about the early life of Voldemort in a device
            called a Pensieve. Harry learns from a drunken Slughorn that he used
            to teach Tom Riddle, and that Voldemort divided his soul into
            pieces, creating a series of Horcruxes. Harry and Dumbledore travel
            to a distant lake to destroy a Horcrux; they succeed, but Dumbledore
            weakens. On their return, they find Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters
            attacking the school. The book ends with the killing of Dumbledore
            by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.<br />In Harry
            Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh novel in the series,
            Lord Voldemort gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron
            and Hermione learn about the Deathly Hallows, legendary items that
            lead to mastery over death. The group infiltrate the ministry, where
            they steal a locket Horcrux, and visit Godric's Hollow, where they
            are attacked by Nagini. A silver doe Patronus leads them to the
            Sword of Gryffindor, with which they destroy the locket. They steal
            a Horcrux from Gringotts and travel to Hogwarts, culminating in a
            battle with Death Eaters. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of
            paranoia, but lends Harry his memories before he dies. Harry learns
            that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore, and that he himself is a
            Horcrux. Harry surrenders to Voldemort and dies. The defenders of
            Hogwarts continue to fight on; Harry is resurrected, faces Voldemort
            and kills him.>br>An epilogue titled "Nineteen Years Later"
            describes the lives of the surviving characters and the impact of
            Voldemort's death. Harry and Ginny are married with three children,
            and Ron and Hermione are married with two children.

          <h1 class="secondary-title">Themes</h1>
          <p>
            Harry Potter's overarching theme is death. In the first book, when
            Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and "a
            terrible sadness" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with
            him. Confronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and
            manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his
            struggles with Dementors. Other characters in Harry's life die; he
            even faces his own death in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
            The series has an existential perspective – Harry must grow mature
            enough to accept death. In Harry's world, death is not binary but
            mutable, a state that exists in degrees. Unlike Voldemort, who
            evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts,
            Harry's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love.<br />Love
            distinguishes Harry and Voldemort. Harry is a hero because he loves
            others, even willing to accept death to save them; Voldemort is a
            villain because he does not. Harry carries the protection of his
            mother's sacrifice in his blood; Voldemort, who wants Harry's blood
            and the protection it carries, does not understand that love
            vanquishes death.<br />Rowling has spoken about thematising death
            and loss in the series. Soon after she started writing Philosopher's
            Stone, her mother died; she said that "I really think from that
            moment on, death became a central, if not the central theme of the
            seven books". Rowling has described Harry as "the prism through
            which I view death", and further stated that "all of my characters
            are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of
            death".<br />While Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good
            vs. evil, its moral divisions are not absolute. First impressions of
            characters are often misleading. Harry assumes in the first book
            that Quirrell is on the side of good because he opposes Snape, who
            appears to be malicious; in reality, Quirrell is an agent of
            Voldemort, while Snape is loyal to Dumbledore. This pattern later
            recurs with Moody and Snape. In Rowling's world, good and evil are
            choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and the
            possibility of redemption are key themes of the series. This is
            reflected in Harry's self-doubts after learning his connections to
            Voldemort, such as Parseltongue; and prominently in Snape's
            characterisation, which has been described as complex and
            multifaceted. In some scholars' view, while Rowling's narrative
            appears on the surface to be about Harry, her focus may actually be
            on Snape's morality and character arc.<br />Rowling said that, to
            her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious".
            In the fourth book, Dumbledore speaks of a "choice between what is
            right and what is easy"; Rowling views this as a key theme, "because
            that ... is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and
            taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep
            trouble".<br />Academics and journalists have developed many other
            interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than
            others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as
            normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have
            all been considered as prevalent throughout the series. Similarly,
            the theme of making one's way through adolescence and "going over
            one's most harrowing ordeals – and thus coming to terms with them"
            has also been considered. Rowling has stated that the books comprise
            "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to
            bigotry" and that they also pass on a message to "question authority
            and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all
            of the truth".

            In 1999, Rowling sold the film rights for Harry Potter to Warner
            Bros. for a reported $1 million. Rowling had creative control on the
            film series, observing the filmmaking process of Philosopher's Stone
            and serving as producer on the two-part Deathly Hallows, alongside
            David Heyman and David Barron. Rowling demanded the principal cast
            be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of
            Irish or French and Eastern European actors where characters from
            the book are specified as such.<br />Chris Columbus was selected as
            the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (titled
            "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States).
            Philosopher's Stone was released on 14 November 2001. Just three
            days after the film's release, production for Harry Potter and the
            Chamber of Secrets, also directed by Columbus, began and the film
            was released on 15 November 2002. Columbus declined to direct Harry
            Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, only acting as producer. Mexican
            director Alfonso Cuarón took over the job, and after shooting in
            2003, the film was released on 4 June 2004. Due to the fourth film
            beginning its production before the third's release, Mike Newell was
            chosen as the director for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,
            released on 18 November 2005. Newell became the first British
            director of the series, with television director David Yates
            following suit after he was chosen to helm Harry Potter and the
            Order of the Phoenix. Production began in January 2006 and the film
            was released the following year in July 2007. Yates was selected to
            direct Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which was released on
            15 July 2009. The final instalment in the series, Harry Potter and
            the Deathly Hallows was released in two cinematic parts: Part 1 on
            19 November 2010 and Part 2 on 15 July 2011.<br />A new prequel
            series consisting of five films will take place before the main
            series. The first film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was
            released in November 2016, followed by the second Fantastic Beasts:
            The Crimes of Grindelwald in November 2018 and Fantastic Beasts: The
            Secrets of Dumbledore in April 2022 with two more to be released.
            Rowling wrote the screenplay for the first three instalments,
            marking her foray into screenwriting.
