        <b>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</b> is a fantasy novel
        written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the
        Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts
        School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on
        the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets"
        has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils
        who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after
        attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the
        year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.

            The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by
            Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by
            Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to
            finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young
            readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the
            story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like
            with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of
            Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have
            condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its
            emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result
            of one's choices.<br />Several commentators have noted that personal
            identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues
            of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and
            non-living people. Some commentators regard the story's diary that
            writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of
            information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be
            checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and
            incompetent.<br />The film adaptation of the novel, released in
            2002, became (at the time) the fifth highest-grossing film ever and
            received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on
            Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for
            several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.

            While spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry
            Potter is visited by a house-elf named Dobby. He warns that Harry is
            in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses, so Dobby
            magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. A
            furious Uncle Vernon locks Harry into his room in retaliation. The
            Ministry of Magic immediately sends a notice accusing Harry of
            performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from
            Hogwarts.<br />Ron Weasley and his brothers, Fred and George, arrive
            in their father's flying Ford Anglia and rescue Harry, taking him to
            the Weasley home. Harry and the entire Weasley family travel to
            Diagon Alley for school supplies. They run into Hermione Granger and
            meet Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry's nemesis Draco, and also
            Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer and adventurer who is
            the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King's Cross
            station, Harry and Ron are unable to enter Platform 9¾ and miss the
            Hogwarts Express. They fly in Mr Weasley's car to Hogwarts, crashing
            into the Whomping Willow on school grounds and damaging Ron's
            hand-me-down wand. The car then escapes into the forest.<br />Harry
            learns that some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born
            wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior. Harry is
            the only one who hears a strange voice emanating from the castle
            walls. Soon after, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified,
            along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: "The Chamber of
            Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware". It is
            believed that Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders,
            created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on
            admitting Muggle-born students. The Chamber supposedly houses a
            monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.<br />During a
            Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm.
            Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the
            hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry there, and reveals he jinxed
            the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the
            Chamber of Secrets was once opened years before. After another
            attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which
            Harry spontaneously exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue',
            the language of snakes.<br />Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco
            is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns. Hermione
            secretly brews Polyjuice Potion, allowing Harry and Ron to
            impersonate Draco's lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. They learn that Draco
            knows nothing about the heir. Meanwhile, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost
            that haunts a girls' bathroom, shows the trio a diary left in her
            stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another
            student's death during the Chamber's previous opening. Riddle's
            consciousness within the diary claims to Harry that Hagrid was
            responsible. Hermione is petrified in the next attack. The school is
            put on lockdown and may close. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore is forced
            out and Hagrid is sent to Azkaban prison.<br />Following
            instructions left by Hagrid, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the
            Forbidden Forest. They encounter a gigantic Acromantula named
            Aragog, which denies its involvement, and claims spiders fear the
            real monster. Aragog attempts to feed Harry and Ron to its progeny,
            but Mr Weasley's car rescues them. Harry and Ron discover that
            Hermione had deduced that the monster is a basilisk – a gigantic
            snake whose direct gaze kills and petrifies victims when seen in a
            reflection. Harry concludes the basilisk is the voice in the walls
            and that it travels through the plumbing. He also realises Moaning
            Myrtle was the student that was killed.<br />Ron's sister Ginny is
            abducted and taken into the Chamber. Harry and Ron discover the
            entrance in Myrtle's bathroom, and force Lockhart to enter it with
            them. Lockhart confesses he is a magically incompetent fraud and
            attempts to erase the boys' memories using Ron's damaged wand. The
            spell backfires, obliterating his own memory and causes a rockfall,
            separating Ron and Harry.<br />Harry proceeds to the Chamber and
            finds an unconscious Ginny. A manifestation of Tom Riddle reveals
            that he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. He previously
            opened the Chamber and framed Hagrid. He has been using the diary to
            possess and control Ginny, who had been behaving strangely. He then
            unleashes the basilisk. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives,
            bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. Fawkes blinds the basilisk and Harry
            pulls the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat. He slays
            the basilisk but is poisoned by its venom. As Riddle taunts the
            dying Harry, Fawkes' tears heal Harry. Harry stabs Riddle's diary
            with a basilisk fang, destroying it and Riddle, and reviving
            Ginny.<br />Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle.
            Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore, who is curious about it. Lucius
            Malfoy bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is
            accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and was working
            to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into
            Ginny's cauldron when in Diagon Alley to open the Chamber. Harry
            tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude; Lucius attempts to
            attack Harry in revenge, but Dobby magically deflects him.<br />The
            petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again,
            Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. Mungo's Hospital,
            and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits.

            <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
            <p>
              A 12-year-old British wizard famous for surviving his parents'
              murder at the hands of the evil wizard Lord Voldemort as an
              infant, who now enters his second year at Hogwarts School of
              Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this book, it is introduced that Harry
              knows Parseltongue, a language used to talk with snakes. To defeat
              the basilisk, Harry summons the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from
              the Sorting Hat supplied by Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes.

            <h2>Ron Weasley</h2>
            <p>
              He is Harry's age and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best
              friend "always there when you need him." He is freckled,
              red-haired and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood
              family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is
              quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily.

            <h2>Hermione Granger</h2>
            <p>
              She is the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who
              has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of
              term. Rowling described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and
              good" character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of
              failure beneath her swottiness". Despite her nagging efforts to
              keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of
              the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and
              analytical skills play an important role in finding the
              Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large
              front teeth. She helped Harry and Ron by making the Polyjuice
              portion and by providing the clue of basilisk.

            <p>
              Ginny is a first-year student in Chamber of Secrets, where she
              develops a crush on Harry and is sorted into Gryffindor. During
              the climax of the story, it is revealed that she opened the
              Chamber of Secrets, and is attacking Muggle-born students while
              being possessed by Tom Riddle's old school diary. Lucius Malfoy
              had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in Flourish and Blotts
              prior to the term.

              He is a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black
              hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was
              snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again),
              however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's
              gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care
              and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most
              dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to
              Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and,
              later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.

            <h2>Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</h2>
            <p>
              He is a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has
              silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the
              headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard
              Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements
              in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own
              brilliance. Rowling described him as the "epitome of goodness".

            <p>
              She is a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a
              tight bun and teaches Transfiguration. She is Deputy Headmistress,
              and Head of Gryffindor House. McGonagall is considered to be a
              formidable witch who is skilled in many forms of magic, notably
              transfiguration and spell-casting. She is able to perform certain
              magic without casting spells or sometimes without the use of a
              wand. McGonagall is a registered Animagus and can transform
              herself into a tabby cat at will. McGonagall was always held in
              high respect by her peers and students at Hogwarts and commanded a
              position second only to Dumbledore.

              He has a hooked nose, sallow complexion and greasy black hair,
              teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the
              Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and
              seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry.

              He is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant
              about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a
              pure-blood wizard and wizards who do not share his views. His
              parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark
              wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco
              avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his
              friends into trouble.

            <p>
              Arthur Weasley is the patriarch of the Weasleys, a family of
              wizards who are considered "blood traitors" by Death Eaters for
              their interest in the Muggle world. He is married to Molly
              Weasley, with whom he has seven children, including Ron, Harry's
              best friend. During his time at Hogwarts, Arthur belonged to the
              house of Gryffindor. Arthur is described as being tall and thin,
              and as having a receding hairline and horn-rimmed glasses. An
              affable, light-hearted man, he tends not to be the authority
              figure in the family; his wife Molly handles that area. Arthur
              works for the Ministry of Magic, initially in the Misuse of Muggle
              Artefacts Office. He is obsessed with learning about Muggle
              customs and inventions and owns a large collection of mostly
              Muggle used items. His department lacks funding, and his salary is
              only just able to provide for a vast family, leaving his family
              finances precarious.

              whiny tone of voice based on that of the Child Catcher of Chitty
              Chitty Bang Bang, whose voice had resonated with Isaacs throughout
              his childhood for the character scaring him.

            <h2>Gilderoy Lockhart</h2>
            <p>
              Gilderoy Lockhart is a popular author and wizarding celebrity who
              has written many books about his adventures encountering dark
              creatures, and is the Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor for
              Chamber of Secrets. He is unpopular with most of the staff,
              particularly Snape. He is greatly admired by many others,
              particularly women (including Hermione and the Weasley mother
              Molly Weasley) who find him attractive. Harry dislikes Lockhart
              for a number of reasons: his arrogance, his belief that Harry flew
              to Hogwarts in Mr. Weasley's car to seek further attention, his
              penchant for handing out signed photos of himself, and the trouble
              he has with simple magic such as healing Harry's broken arm (he
              accidentally vanishes Harry's arm bones instead). Lockhart is
              exposed as a charlatan and a coward when he attempts to avoid
              entering the Chamber of Secrets by revealing to Harry and Ron that
              he never performed the amazing feats documented in his books,
              instead passing off the experiences of other witches and wizards
              as his own and erasing their memories to prevent them from
              revealing the truth. He attempts to cast a Memory Charm on Harry
              and Ron using Ron's damaged wand, but the spell backfires and
              leaves him with near-total amnesia.

            <br />Other members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher
            and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick,
            the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House,
            the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who
            does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the
            Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical
            teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing
            trouble wherever he can.<br />In the book, Rowling introduces an
            eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is
            Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the
            eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable
            childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a
            "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a
            wizard" and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her
            mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends,
            Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as
            the ultimate best friend, "always there when you need him". Rowling
            has described Hermione as a "very logical, upright and good"
            character with "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure
            beneath her swottiness".<br />Rowling also imagined a supporting
            cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind
            wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling
            described him as "the epitome of goodness". His right hand is severe
            Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved
            Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape.
            Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.<br />The main
            antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate, and
            Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes
            disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. It is later revealed
            that:<br /><i

                >In early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick
                sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the
                circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the
                book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been
                subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official
                website. The family background of Dean Thomas was removed
                because Rowling and her publishers considered it an "unnecessary
                digression," and she considered Neville Longbottom's own journey
                of discovery "more important to the central plot."</b

            <i><b>Theme of the Book:-</b></i>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets continues to examine what
            makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As
            well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions
            rather than any aspect of his birth, Harry Potter and the Chamber of
            Secrets provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their
            true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart "lacks
            any real identity" because he is nothing more than a charming liar.
            Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by
            pointing out the similarities between the two: "both half-bloods,
            orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to
            come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin."<br />Opposition to
            class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice,
            love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes
            of the series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's
            consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human
            Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite
            Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard
            work than on natural talents.<br />Edward Duffy, associate professor
            at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of
            Chamber of Secrets is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes
            control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests
            Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming
            information from sources that have their own agendas. Although
            Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an
            instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers
            of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the
            author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's
            self-promoting books.<br />Immorality and the portrayal of authority
            as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause
            states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world,
            for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he
            considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy. At the
            end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore retracts
            his promise to punish Harry, Ron, and Hermione if they break any
            more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have
            broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat
            from the Chamber of Secrets. Krause further states that authority
            figures and political institutions receive little respect from
            Rowling. William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland,
            Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a
            mediocrity. In his article "Harry Potter and the Secular City", Ken
            Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle
            of bureaucratic empires, saying that "Ministry officials busy
            themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses)
            and coin politically correct euphemisms like 'non-magical community'
            (for Muggles) and 'memory modification' (for magical brainwashing)."
            <br />This novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for
            Nearly-Headless Nick's 500th deathday party bears the words "Sir
            Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492".
